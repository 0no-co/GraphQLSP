# GraphQLSP

This is a TypeScript LSP Plugin that will recognise documents in your
TypeScript code and help you out with hover-information, diagnostics and
auto-complete.

## Features

- Hover information showing the decriptions of fields
- Diagnostics for adding fields that don't exist, are deprecated, missmatched argument types, ...
- Auto-complete inside your editor for fields
- Will warn you when you are importing from a file that is exporting fragments that you're not using

> Note that this plugin does not do syntax highlighting, for that you still need something like
> [the VSCode/... plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax)

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @0no-co/graphqlsp
```

## Usage

Go to your `tsconfig.json` and add

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
        "schema": "./schema.graphql"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

now restart your TS-server and you should be good to go, ensure you are using the
workspace version of TypeScript. In VSCode you can do so by clicking the bottom right
when on a TypeScript file or adding a file like [this](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP/blob/main/packages/example/.vscode/settings.json).

> If you are using VSCode ensure that your editor is using [the Workspace Version of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript)
> this can be done by manually selecting it or adding a `.vscode/config.json` with the contents of
>
> ```json
> {
>   "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
>   "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
> }
> ```

### Configuration

**Required**

- `schema` allows you to specify a url, `.json` or `.graphql` file as your schema. If you need to specify headers for your introspection
  you can opt into the object notation i.e. `{ "schema": { "url": "x", "headers": { "Authorization": "y" } }}`

**Optional**

- `template` add an additional template to the defaults `gql` and `graphql`
- `templateIsCallExpression` this tells our client that you are using `graphql('doc')` (default: true)
  when using `false` it will look for tagged template literals
- `shouldCheckForColocatedFragments` when turned on, this will scan your imports to find
  unused fragments and provide a message notifying you about them (only works with call-expressions, default: true)
- `trackFieldUsage` this only works with the client-preset, when turned on it will warn you about
  unused fields within the same file. (only works with call-expressions, default: true)
- `tadaOutputLocation` when using `gql.tada` this can be convenient as it automatically generates
  an `introspection.ts` file for you, just give it the directory to output to and you're done
- `reservedKeys` this setting will affect `trackFieldUsage`, you can enter keys here that will be ignored
  from usage tracking, so when they are unused in the component but used in i.e. the normalised cache you
  won't get annoying warnings. (default `id`, `_id` and `__typename`, example: ['slug'])

## Tracking unused fields

Currently the tracking unused fields feature has a few caveats with regards to tracking, first and foremost
it will only track the result and the accessed properties in the same file to encourage
[fragment co-location](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#colocating-fragments).

Secondly, we don't track mutations/subscriptions as some folks will add additional fields to properly support
normalised cache updates.

## Fragment masking

When we use a `useQuery` that supports `TypedDocumentNode` it will automatically pick up the typings
from the `query` you provide it. However for fragments this could become a bit more troublesome, the
minimal way of providing typings for a fragment would be the following:

```tsx
import { TypedDocumentNode } from '@graphql-typed-document-node/core';

export const PokemonFields = gql`
  fragment pokemonFields on Pokemon {
    id
    name
  }
` as typeof import('./Pokemon.generated').PokemonFieldsFragmentDoc;

export const Pokemon = props => {
  const pokemon = useFragment(props.pokemon, PokemonFields);
};

export function useFragment<Type>(
  data: any,
  _fragment: TypedDocumentNode<Type>
): Type {
  return data;
}
```

This is mainly needed in cases where this isn't supported out of the box and mainly serves as a way
for you to case your types.

## Local development

Run `pnpm i` at the root. Open `packages/example` by running `code packages/example` or if you want to leverage
breakpoints do it with the `TSS_DEBUG_BRK=9559` prefix. When you make changes in `packages/graphqlsp` all you need
to do is run `pnpm i` in your other editor and restart the `TypeScript server` for the changes to apply.

> Ensure that both instances of your editor are using the Workspace Version of TypeScript
