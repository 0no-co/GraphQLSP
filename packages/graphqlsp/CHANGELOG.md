      {
        "name": "pokemons",
        "schema": "./pokemons.graphql",
        "tadaOutputLocation": "./pokemons-introspection.d.ts"

### Patch Changes

- When we have a query like the following

  ```graphql
  query {
    pokemon(id: 1) {
      id
      name
    }
    pokemons {
      id
      fleeRate
    }
  }
  ```

  and we perform

  ```ts
  const Pokemons = () => {
    const [result] = useQuery({
      query: PokemonQuery,
    });

    return result.data.pokemons.map(pokemon => pokemon.fleeRate);
  };
  ```

  Then it will see `pokemon` the variable inside our function closure as an
  allowed field due to `Query.pokemon` this PR fixes that by refining our search
  algorithm to only include valid built paths.
