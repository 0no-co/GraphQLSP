## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for defining multiple indepenent schemas through a new config property called `schemas`, you can
  pass a config like the following:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "@0no-co/graphqlsp",
    "schemas": [
      {
        "name": "pokemons",
        "schema": "./pokemons.graphql",
        "tadaOutputLocation": "./pokemons-introspection.d.ts"
      },
      {
        "name": "weather",
        "schema": "./weather.graphql",
        "tadaOutputLocation": "./weather-introspection.d.ts"
      }
    ]

  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#185](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP/pull/185))

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- When we have a query like the following

  ```graphql
  query {
    pokemon(id: 1) {
      id
      name
    }
    pokemons {
      id
      fleeRate
    }
  }
  ```

  and we perform

  ```ts
  const Pokemons = () => {
    const [result] = useQuery({
      query: PokemonQuery,
    });

    return result.data.pokemons.map(pokemon => pokemon.fleeRate);
  };
  ```

  Then it will see `pokemon` the variable inside our function closure as an
  allowed field due to `Query.pokemon` this PR fixes that by refining our search
  algorithm to only include valid built paths.

### Minor Changes

- Add a `message` diagnostic when we see an import from a file that has `fragment` exports we'll warn you when they are not imported, this because of the assumption that to use this file one would have to adhere to the data requirements of said file.
  You can choose to disable this setting by setting `shouldCheckForColocatedFragments` to `false`
